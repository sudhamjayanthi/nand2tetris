speedrunning nand2tetris and documenting notes publicly

for those who don't know [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course) is a introductory course for the low level hardware + software systems the work all the way between a NAND chip to making a tetris game in the course of 12 projects.

the first six weeks cover building the hardware using HDL, and following six are about building software that will enable us to reach our final goal: a tetris game on our very own computer. here's a more detailed [doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWCOVIcg0-dX0XtL3KwNyra6jzMogXLL/view) from the official website on what's covered.

i'll get started now, noting down insights, realisations and learnings as i try to speedrun through this course trying to understand as much as possible in as little time as possible. let's see if we make it! 

next: [[Project 1]]
